# Documenting Components

To document your new component, all you need to do is add a `.mdx` page next to it.

You component will automatically be available in the scope of mdx files after being added to the exports of the library.

## Conventions

By default your page should be built up using the following sections:

- **Intro** talk about the component and its purpose, help people think about this component.
- **Usage** gives examples of common usages for your component. Include at least an example with the minimum amount of props needed to use the component.
- **Figma** link to related Figma files so that we can easily check that implementation and design are the same.
- **Props** finally, have a table with all of your components props so users know how they can adopt it.

## Editable preview

You can use ` ```jsx` blocks to document and preview your code at the same time.

```
```jsx
<Button>Click</Button>
```

Will produce:

```jsx
<Button>Click</Button>
```

### Limitations

Inside a `jsx` code block there needs to be a single parent component.

You can use a [fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) `<> /* Code here */ </>` to wrap your code.

### Stateful components

If you need state management to demo your component you can wrap it in an anonymous function to do so.

```jsx
() => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return (
    <Button onClick={() => setCount(current => current += 1)}>
      {count}
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Props

On a components documentation page you can add a list of all it's properties using the `<PropsTable of="ComponentName" />` component.

>This requires your component to use named exports!

Simply pass in the name of your component and the list will be generated. To enable this you need to run and locally update the generation script for props documentation.

```bash
cd propsDoc && npm run build && cd ..
```

**Descriptions**, for properties to have descriptions, you need to add them via JS-docs `/** description */`.

Under the hood this uses [react-docgen-typescript](https://github.com/styleguidist/react-docgen-typescript) to generate a JSON file with props definitions for each components. They are than exposed through a TypeScript file with typings. Preferrably we would also do this via contentlayer but TypeScript or Plaintext files are currently not supported.

## Figma

When documenting the implementation of components designed in Figma you can provide a link to Figma. It will be replaced by an embed of the Figma file. Please note that this needs to be a markdown link, use that chance to describe what you are linking to for readers of the makrdown file.

In Figma, select the area you are interested im embedding and right-click it. Now select "Copy/Paste as" and then "Copy link".

```

## Callout blocks

You can use quotes in markdown to create callout blocks.
